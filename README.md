# Course Database - V2

This `Typescript` rest API was based on a course project I made at UBC. All contributions made by `Tom Mo` are mine. Most contributions are in `queryOnDataset`. A query engine implementing queries specified in the `bnf` file. 

## Project commands

1. `yarn install` to install npm packages

1. `yarn build` to build the package

1. `yarn start` to run the app

Visit `localhost:4321` for a simple frontend query table for the database. 

## Credits

 - Credits to UBC for providing the initial Boilerplate, and for all the help they provided through the term. 

 - Credits to Sizhe Fan for developing the dataset parser, and for being a good partner!
